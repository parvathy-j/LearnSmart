# LearnSmart
My project for the Future ready talent virtual internship.
Technologies used:
Visual Studio Code/
Azure App Service.
Azure DevOps

As a student and a self-learner I've always felt the need of a single solution to the information overload that comes with learning on the internet .In talks with peers the idea has often come up as well. The reason most students struggle with it, is the inability to recall what has been read .The best way to enhance memory recall ,in my opinion, is through flash cards and highlighting important information which is what we do with traditional way of learning from physical books .The idea of the project is to enhance the learners productivity and active memory recall with the use of AI escalating the same concepts of traditional learning into a modern one  .This web solution will be developed in Visual Studio Code, built with Azure DevOps, and then deployed using Azure App service
         This solution is to include features such as highlighter ,Flashcard and pomodoro timer. It contains modal windows that include login and signup option.This project will augment online learning with the use of the azure technologies .The flashcard coud use Azure Language studio feature key phrase extraction but it is beyond the scope of my skill set .The higlighter was slated to be developed as an extension that receives data from all websites that the user highlights without it being too intrusive.
