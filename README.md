# LearnSmart
My project for the Future ready talent virtual internship.
Technologies used:
Visual Studio Code,
Azure App Service,
Azure DevOps

As a student and a self-learner I've always felt the need of a single solution to the information overload that comes with learning from the internet .In talks with peers the idea has often come up as well. The reason most students struggle with it, is the inability to recall what has been read .The best way to enhance memory recall ,in my opinion, is through flash cards and highlighting important information which is what we do with traditional way of learning with physical books .The idea of the project is to enhance the learners productivity and active memory recall with the use of AI escalating the same concepts of traditional learning into a modern one  .This web solution will be developed in Visual Studio Code, built with Azure DevOps, and then deployed using Azure App service
         This solution is to include features such as highlighter ,Flashcard and pomodoro timer. It contains modal windows that include login and signup option.This project will augment online learning with the use of the azure technologies .
                 The flashcard would use Azure Language studio feature-key phrase extraction.
         The higlighter was intended to be developed as an extension that receives data from all websites that the user highlights without it being too intrusive but as i dwelled into the reasearch to find a way to develope this idea i ran into trouble.I'm mostly familiar with front end developement .
         I'm a beginner and also a self-learner,My backcground is in the commerce field.API coding was necessary to receive data from the web and while i believe i can learn and develope the app into what i originally intended for it to be, i have realised that my initial idea was too ambitious for a beginner and  with a deadline it seemed impossible.Hence,I have created a static website with basic HTML,Javascript and CSS.
         Apologies for any mistakes that maybe found in my code
         
         Thank you,
